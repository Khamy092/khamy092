# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

üëã Hi there! I'm Taqi, and this is my GitHub profile. I'm passionate about software development, AI, ethical hacking, and open source projects. Here, you'll find a collection of my personal projects, contributions to various open source initiatives, and more. Feel free to explore, contribute, or simply drop by to say hello.

## About Me

I'm a software developer with a keen interest in web development, machine learning, and everything in between. I love building things that are both functional and beautiful. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing futsal with friends or wataching a good movie.

## My Projects

Here are some of the projects you'll find in my GitHub repositories:

These are just a few examples of what I've been working on. Feel free to check them out, open issues, submit pull requests, or just give them a star if you find them interesting!

## Open Source Contributions

I'm a firm believer in the power of open source software. I've contributed to various projects and libraries, and I'm always looking for new ways to give back to the community. If you have an open source project that needs some help or collaboration, don't hesitate to reach out.
